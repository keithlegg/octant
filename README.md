THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS. Not ready to run any machines yet. Soon, hopefully.


From Reddit:

"If you're thinking of writing your own controller software and hoping it's more reliable than open source or commercially available products, you're truly out to lunch."

Any machinery capable of harming persons must have
provisions for completely removing power from all
motors, etc., before persons enter any danger area.

All machinery must be designed to comply with local 
and national safety codes, and the authors of this 
software cannot and do not, take any responsibility 
for such compliance.
